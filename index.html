    As data centers proliferate, urban planners play a key role in permitting associated land uses and anticipating their system-wide impacts on the built environment and urban life. Yet the current information landscape is fragmented across the energy, water, and regulatory sectors, with uneven quality and sometimes contradictory claims. 
<br><br>
This interactive visualization is a supplement to the white paper <a href="https://www.xiaofanliang.com/publication/DataCenterVis/DataCenter101.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“From Infrastructure to Implications: Data Center 101 for Urban Planners” (Liang, 2026)</a>. This draws on desktop research using high-quality sources and interviews with nine industry stakeholders, including data center developers, urban planners, elected officials, and contractors to answer a central question: <strong style="color: #000;">what are data centers’ implications for the urban life and built environment, and how are those implications anchored in specific data center infrastructure components?</strong>
<br><br>
Use interactive visualization to explore relationships between a stylized, simplified design of a hyperscale data center and key implications. This diagram is illustrative and conceptual rather than exhaustive; real-world facilities vary and may include additional infrastructure or omit elements shown here.

<b>Generation, Transmission, Distribution </b>
<br><br>
Data centers introduce a new type of infrastructure demand: large, continuous electricity loads that are shaped by computing needs and cooling system design and served through transmission lines, electrical substations, and on-site backup energy systems such as diesel generators, batteries, or microgrids. The large load can trigger upgrades to these infrastructures which further reshape regional power planning, influence clean-energy transitions, and affect how reliability risks are managed during extreme events. At the local level, data center interconnections may compete with housing, electrification, and economic development for limited grid capacity, while the costs of new infrastructure may be shared across ratepayers in complex ways. Associated facilities can also change community landscapes through visual impacts, noise, traffic, and air pollution. For planners, these implications matter because they shape land-use compatibility, infrastructure investment priorities, and the fairness of who bears the costs and risks of accommodating this new form of growth.

	<b>Water Source, Water Use, Water Discharge</b>
        <br><br>
Water is central to remove heat from server operation. Data centers draw from municipal systems and, in some cases, groundwater sources via dedicated water lines, while wastewater from cooling systems are routed to local treatment plants. Because water is inherently local and cannot be transmitted across regions like electricity, large data center demands can strain regional water supplies and trigger costly infrastructure upgrades. These upgrades are often required late in the development process, placing financial and operational pressure on water utilities, especially in smaller or rural communities. Water use varies significantly by cooling system design and the tradeoff between water and energy efficiency. Data centers that rely on evaporative cooling can consume substantial volumes of water, with much of it lost to the atmosphere, and may require additional storage such as independent water towers. For urban planners, the central challenge is that cooling technology choices directly shape energy efficiency, water uses, and environmental impacts, which then affect long-term water resource planning and infrastructure investment needs. Planners can respond by coordinating with water utilities early, requiring transparent disclosure of projected water demand, and, where appropriate, setting cooling-system standards or conditions in zoning and site-plan review to align data center growth with local water capacity and resilience goals.

<b>Zoning, Land Market, Long-term Planning</b> 
<br><br>
Data centers require proximity to electrical substations, transmission lines, and fiber-optic backbones, which can introduce new land uses associated with these supporting infrastructures and reshaping how land is zoned, valued, and developed. Local zoning frameworks determine where and how these facilities are permitted, but data centers often do not fit neatly into existing industrial or commercial categories due to their scale, infrastructure demands, and operational characteristics. Their development can trigger farmland conversion, land-value speculation, competition for industrial land, and the siting of associated facilities such as substations, transmission corridors, and water infrastructure. Over time, the land-use footprint of data centers shapes not only the feasibility of individual sites but also broader questions about strategic co-location of mutually beneficial uses, land-value speculation, growth management, compatibility with surrounding development, and the long-term end use or reuse of such large, single-purpose facilities. For planners, the central challenge is navigating uncertain and rapidly evolving industry needs while accounting for implications for land markets, community compatibility, and future reuse.

<b>Housing,
Transportation,   
Residential Experience</b>
<br><br>

Data centers can affect nearby residents’ quality of life through noise from diesel generators and cooling fans, light pollution from 24/7 street lighting for security, neighborhood traffic disruptions during construction or emergency fueling activities, and visual impacts from large, windowless server hall buildings, expanded transmission lines, and fortified security perimeters. Landscape screening is a common though limited mitigation strategy to soften these visual effects. In addition, data centers can generate substantial traffic on local roads during construction, and the number drops significantly once in operation. Still, operational staff will need dedicated employee parking and loading bays for equipment. Over the longer term, local housing demand increases as construction and operations workers seek nearby living options. For planners, the central challenge is anticipating and managing these cumulative, place-based impacts on housing markets, transportation systems, and everyday residential experience when many effects emerge gradually, cross jurisdictional boundaries, and are difficult to reverse once facilities and supporting infrastructure are in place.

<b>Tax Revenue, 
Jobs,    
Ancillary Businesses</b>
<br><br>

Data centers contribute significant tax revenues to local governments, from real estate and property taxes on infrastructure investments to business and sales taxes generated by daily operations and computer equipment in server halls. They also create direct and indirect jobs in office and site operations. The job counts tend to be higher during the construction phase than in ongoing operations. Data centers’ high tax yield per capita can make them attractive to jurisdictions seeking new revenue sources, yet the relatively small number of permanent jobs raises questions about the depth and distribution of local economic benefits. These dynamics are further complicated by tax incentives, negotiated abatements, and uneven bargaining power across jurisdictions, which can shape how much value communities ultimately retain. For planners, the central challenge is evaluating whether the fiscal gains, employment opportunities, and secondary economic activity justify the long-term land, infrastructure, and public resource commitments, especially when benefits are immediate and visible, but costs and tradeoffs unfold over decades and vary widely across communities.

<b>Air & Heat,
Water & Waste, 
Governance</b>
<br><br>

Data centers create layered environmental impacts. Heat from server halls is released through cooling systems. Air pollution is driven largely by backup diesel generators that emit PM2.5 and NOx during testing and outages, while water and chemical risks depend on how cooling systems are designed and managed. In addition, 24/7 street lighting can contribute to light pollution and nighttime skyglow, especially near residential areas and sensitive habitats. Over time, rapid equipment turnover in server halls generates substantial e-waste, potentially implicating persistent chemicals such as Pfas. Regulation is strongest for air emissions and wastewater permits, but far weaker for localized heat and light externalities, making environmental outcomes highly dependent on how these infrastructure components are designed, monitored, and governed. For planners, the central challenge is navigating fragmented regulatory authority across local, state, and federal levels, alongside scientific uncertainty, while making land-use decisions that embed long-term environmental externalities, many of which are incremental, dispersed, and not fully captured by existing permitting frameworks.
